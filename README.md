# museum_of_candy_project

Welcome to the Museum of Candy. It's a simple & minimalistic project using Bootstrap Utilities including the Grid System & Navbar Element.
Also has Bootstrap JQuery & JS for the Collapsing Navbar Effect & a little bit of JS from my side to introduce a Scrolling Effect to Navbar.
Lots of Bootstrap Classes, a little CSS for cherry on top & minor JS for Navbar tweaks!!
